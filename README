Code that I used in this project:

Step1: firstly, I downloaded the git from the official site for my windows PC:
Step 2: Install it, and check it's version

git --version

It shows the version that means, It was successfully installed!

----------------
No, i set the user name and email through:

git config --global user.name
and git config --global user.email

and cross check it by using:

git config user.name & git config user.email

--------------------------

What's next:

i have Created respository 'edureka-transaction-api' through my github... 

and then clone it...using the code

git clone https://github.com/nahidprawez/edureka-transaction-api.git

-----------
To check the current branch, I have used this command:

Since, there is no branch, SO I will create the first one:
git checkout -b 'nahid'

Now, I will add 2 files

and check the status through command:

git status

, this will result the untracked the files where changes have been made.

Now, to tracke the files:

git add .
